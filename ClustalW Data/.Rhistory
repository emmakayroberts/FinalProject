summary(data)
## Problem 1
#### a) Tabulate the pmf of X.
| X | P(X) |
| ----- | ----- |
| -1  | 39/52 |
| 1  | 9/52 |
| 2  | 4/52 |
#### b)
```{r}
1 - (pnorm(0,-0.4230769,1.025561))
```
P(X>0) = 0.3399
This means that 33% of the time profits are greater than zero.
#### c)
E = -0.4230769
sd = 1.025561
E = (-1*(39/52)) + (1*(9/52)) + (2*(4/52))
sd = sqrt((0.75*(-1+0.4230769)^2)+(9/52* (1+0.4230769)^2)+(4/52*(2+0.4230769)^2))
#### d)
Since there is a probability of 0.3399 of "breaking even" with 0 dollars profit, it is probably not wise to repeatedly play this game since the majority of the time you would be losing money.
## Problem 2
#### a) One basketball player attempts 10 free throws and the number of successful attempts is totalled.
The random process here is a binomial process. It consists of 10 indentical trials. Each trial has 2 possible outcomes; a basket or a miss. The probability for success is the same for all trials, and the trials are independent of one another.
#### b) Ten different basketball players each attempt 1 free throw and the total number of successful attempts is totalled.
The random process here is not a binomial process. While there are ten trials, with 2 possible outcomes, and the trials are independent of one another, the probability for success in each trial is not the same, as all of the different basketball players have different free throw percentages.
## Problem 3
B∼Bin(20,0.2)
#### a) P(B=4) = 0.2181994
```{r}
dbinom(4,20,0.2)
```
#### b) P(B<1) = 0.06917529
```{r}
pbinom(1,20,0.2)
```
#### c) P(B>1) = 0.9309
1 - 0.06917529 = 0.9309
## Problem 4
X∼N(10,25)
#### a)
P(X≤11) = 0.579
```{r}
pnorm(11,10,5)
```
#### b)
P(X≥8.4) = 0.625
```{r}
1 - pnorm(8.4,10,5)
```
#### c)
P(X≤x)=0.95, x = 18.2
```{r}
qnorm(0.95,10,5)
```
####d)
P(7.5≤X≤15) = 0.532
```{r}
pnorm(15,10,5) - pnorm(7.5,10,5)
```
## Problem 5
#### a)
```{r}
data = c(7,13.2,8.1,8.2,6,9.5,9.4,8.7,9.8,10.9,8.4,7.4,8.4,10,9.7,8.6,12.4,10.7,11,9.4)
qqnorm(data)
qqline(data)
```
This data is plausibly from a normal population as it follows a linear trend.
#### b)
```{r}
data = c(2.5,1.8,2.6,-1.9,1.6,2.6,1.4,0.9,1.2,2.3,-1.5,1.5,2.5,2.9,-0.1)
qqnorm(data)
qqline(data)
```
While some of this data follows a linear trend, overall as a whole there is deviation from the linear trend and therefore most likely not from a normal population.
#### c)
```{r}
data = c(3.3,1.7,3.3,3.3,2.4,0.5,1.1,1.7,12,14.4,12.8,11.2,10.9,11.7,11.7,11.6)
qqnorm(data)
qqline(data)
```
This data is massively deviated from the linear trend, and it is not from a normal population.

```
1b. 50 percent of the highest points are greater than the value located at vertical line inside the boxplot.
1c. The height in the 75th percentile is the 3rd Quartile, or 10624.

sd(spider)
```
2b. The mean, or the average running speed (cm/s) of a certain species of spider is 2.609333 cm/s. The standard deviation is 0.6178473 cm/s, which means any spider from the data set is on average 0.6178473 cm/s away from the mean value.
2c. summary(spider)

1.250   2.340   2.870   2.609   2.990   3.410
the answers computed from R agree with the calculations done by hand.
2d. The range 3.41-1.25 = 2.16. The IQR for the data is 2.99-2.34 = 0.65
2e.The probability that a randomly chosen spider will have a running speed greater than 2.00cm/s is 0.75, 3/5, or 75%.
Problem 3
a. Histogram A has a larger mean, as the majority of the values fall around 50. Histogram B, while skewed right, still has the majority of its value at much less than 50, so we can assume its mean is smaller.
b. Histogram B has a larger standard deviation, because its values are much more spread out than Histogram A's, creating a larger average distance from the mean.
Problem 4
a. The probability that the two chosen flies have the same color is 0.58.
b. given that the first fly is black, the probability that the second fly is gray is still 0.7, since we assume that the draws are independepnt of each other. If the draws were dependent, the probability of the gray fly would be chosen after a black fly was already chosen would be greater than 0.7.

0.185/0.365
(0.185+0.537)/1
Recall the definition of independence from Q1. Two events A and B are independent if and only if P(A and B)=P(A)×P(B). You can read P(A) as “the probability of event A”.
Define events. Let A be “a randomly chosen employee is female”. Let B be “a randomly chosen employee has a management job”.
Find the necessary probabilities. Two of these are given in part 1 of this question, so all we need to find is P(A). P(A)=0.463, P(B)=0.365, and P(A and B)=0.185.
Apply the formula. We need to multiply P(A) with P(B) and check whether it is the same as P(A and B).
0.463*0.365
## [1] 0.168995
This does not equal P(A and B)=0.185, so events A (female) and B (management job) are not independent.
A simple event is one outcome from the set of all possible outcomes in an experiment. In other words, if you put together all of the simple events, you get every possible outcome of the experiment.
